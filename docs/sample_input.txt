Batman is a popular fictional superhero who first appeared in comic books published by DC Comics in 1939. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, Batman is known for being a masked vigilante who fights crime in the fictional city of Gotham.

The character of Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, which fueled his desire to combat crime and seek justice. Wayne, a billionaire industrialist, uses his wealth and resources to create a secret identity as Batman. He relies on his intelligence, detective skills, martial arts training, and an array of gadgets and technology to fight against criminals and protect Gotham City.

One of Batman's defining characteristics is his lack of superhuman powers. Instead, he relies on his physical prowess, tactical thinking, and gadgets like the Batarang, Batmobile, and Bat-Signal. Batman's costume, designed to strike fear into criminals, includes a bat emblem on his chest, a cape, and a cowl with pointed ears.

Throughout his comic book history, Batman has faced a wide range of adversaries, including iconic villains such as the Joker, Catwoman, Two-Face, Penguin, and Bane. He is also a founding member of the superhero team known as the Justice League, alongside other DC Comics characters like Superman and Wonder Woman.

Some notable portrayals of Batman on the big screen include the Tim Burton-directed films of the 1980s and 1990s, Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" trilogy, and the DC Extended Universe films.

Batman's dark and brooding nature, complex psychology, and commitment to justice have made him one of the most beloved and enduring superheroes in popular culture. His enduring popularity has allowed him to become a symbol of determination, resourcefulness, and the triumph of justice over evil.
